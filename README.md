    ```

2. **Open Chrome Extensions page**

    - Or go to Menu → More Tools → Extensions

3. **Enable Developer Mode**

    - Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner

    - Select the `CleanURLS` folder you downloaded

5. **Configure rules** (Optional)
    - Click on the extension options
    - Add custom rules as needed

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Default Rules

The extension comes with pre-configured rules to remove common tracking parameters:

-   `utm_*` (Google Analytics)
-   `fbclid` (Facebook)
-   `gclid` (Google Ads)
-   `msclkid` (Microsoft Ads)
-   `ref` and `referrer`
-   And many more...

### Custom Rules

Access the options page to create your own cleaning rules:

1. **Regex Pattern**: A regular expression that matches parameter names or values
2. **Replacement**:
    - Leave empty to remove the parameter entirely
    - Enter text to replace the parameter value

#### Example Rules

| Pattern     | Replacement | Description                        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `utm_.*`    | _(empty)_   | Remove all UTM tracking parameters |
| `fbclid`    | _(empty)_   | Remove Facebook click identifier   |
| `ref`       | _(empty)_   | Remove referrer parameters         |
| `sessionid` | `cleaned`   | Replace session ID with 'cleaned'  |

## 🛡️ Privacy

-   **No Data Collection**: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data
-   **Local Processing**: All URL cleaning happens locally in your browser
-   **Open Source**: Full source code is available for review
-   **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for functionality

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Page Load**: When you visit a page, the extension checks the current URL
2. **URL Cleaning**: If tracking parameters are found, the URL is cleaned and the page redirects
3. **Link Monitoring**: The extension monitors for new links added to the page
4. **Real-time Updates**: Links are cleaned as they appear, ensuring privacy protection
